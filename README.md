# tarokk
Hungarian Tarock card game

Initial, command line version. <br>
Under development. <br>

In current stage, best is to enter a python command line interpreter, and then  <br>
> \>\>\> execfile("tarock.py")  # runs a random tarock game with random players <br>
> \>\>\> auto(False)  # so that user can also play <br>
> \>\>\> n   # single-char command to run the next party, basically equivalent to <br>
> \>\>\> table.newParty()
